# Automating-Lights-and-Music
This automates the lights and music in the house just by taking the input of the emotion that a person dipicts

Overview
This project automates the control of lights and music to create an ambient experience based on user input, time of day, or other environmental factors. By integrating smart lights and music systems, it brings an intelligent and automated approach to managing home entertainment and comfort.

Features
Automated Lights Control: Adjusts lighting based on user preferences, time of day, or motion sensors.
Music Automation: Plays or stops music based on user input or predefined schedules.
Voice Control: Integration with voice assistants (like Alexa or Google Assistant) for hands-free control.
Event-Based Triggers: Automatically adjusts lights and music based on events (e.g., movie time, party mode, or morning routine).
Mobile/PC App: Provides an interface to control both lights and music remotely.

Technologies Used
Python
Smart Lighting APIs (e.g., Philips Hue, LIFX, etc.)
Music APIs (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
Voice Assistants Integration (Alexa, Google Assistant)
Time Scheduling (for automatic control based on time of day)
IoT Devices (e.g., smart lights, speakers, motion sensors)

Sample Output
Lights adjust automatically based on the time of day or events.
Music starts or stops when triggered (e.g., at specific times or by voice command).
Notifications or logs are displayed in the console for successful automation.

Future Improvements
Voice control: Further integrate with voice assistants for better hands-free control.
Advanced schedules: More complex event-based automation (e.g., syncing lights with music tempo).
Mobile app integration: Build a companion app for mobile control of lights and music.
